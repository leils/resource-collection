# resource-collection
A text repository of interesting tools, texts, references, and thought-provoking writing
Inspired by [Allison Parrish's](https://github.com/aparrish/text-resources)


## Tools 

A lot of my work is in rapid prototyping and quickly getting an interaction going. 
- Code-wise, I work in-browser (HTML & JS) and on microcontrollers (Arduino). I play around a lot in [P5.js](http://p5js.org).
- For quick websites that need to be online fast, I use [Glitch](glitch.com). For small, server-less sites, they're on Github Pages. 
- I use [MaxMSP](https://cycling74.com) for quickly prototyping things that require signal manipulation & audio.
- All of my drawings are done in [Procreate](https://procreate.com), but I also sometimes use it to prototype touch-screen interactions.
- 2D designs happen in Illustrator. 3D designs and PCBs are in Fusion360.

### Other tools I think are cool:
- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) is for collecting research**

- [Telescopic Text](https://github.com/jackyzha0/telescopic-text) by Jacky Zhao, more poetic interactive web
- [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/en) Intro to 2d Games
- [Engine.lol](https://engine.lol/alpha/) A web-based game engine by Chia Amisola
