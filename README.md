# resource-collection
A text repository of interesting tools, texts, references, and thought-provoking writing
Inspired by [Allison Parrish's](https://github.com/aparrish/text-resources)

If I find myself referencing something in conversation more than twice, I try to put it here. 


## Tools 

A lot of my work is in rapid prototyping and quickly getting an interaction going. 
- Code-wise, I work in-browser (HTML & JS) and on microcontrollers (Arduino). I play around a lot in [P5.js](http://p5js.org).
- For quick websites that need to be online fast, I use [Glitch](glitch.com) or [Replit](https://replit.com/). For small, server-less sites, they're on Github Pages. 
- I use [MaxMSP](https://cycling74.com) for quickly prototyping things that require signal manipulation & audio.
- All of my drawings are done in [Procreate](https://procreate.com), but I also sometimes use it to prototype touch-screen interactions.
- 2D designs happen in Illustrator. 3D designs and PCBs are in Fusion360.
- I also sketch on paper a lot! Paper, pencil, cardboard, glue. 

Other tools that I think are cool: 

- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) is for collecting research**
